The core scenarios we focused on were users who:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Needed a room in the short term (2 days in advance \/ weekend, a treat, celebration of anniversary, an event, business trip combined with weekend etc)<\/li>\n<li>Needed a room for that night &#8211; sense of emergency due to business (meeting), unpredictable situation (missed flight, drunk), romance, I have booked my flight but haven\u2019t found a hotel in my destination yet and inspire me or show me some offers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>We then did a fast sketching exercise for each scenario, presenting the sketches back to the group in order to generate as many ideas as possible in an open environment. At this stage no idea is a bad one as emphasis is on strict timing to generate quick ideas before selecting the best.<\/p>\n<p>Generally the ideas fell into two areas:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Map centric experiences \u2013 where we investigated the use of notifications on top of maps. We played with different interactions allowing the user could to swap between the two different views<\/li>\n<li>Time centric experiences \u2013 where we explored the comparison of results based on destination, user needs and transport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5928\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Sketches.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5928\" alt=\"Sketches from workshop\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Sketches-1024x749.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sketches from workshop<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<h3>Creating the right personality<\/h3>\n<p>So by focusing on our aim to achieve a playful yet functional UI experience, we set about looking at and improving the iconography. We introduced constant line weights and we brought in rounded corners in order to evoke a softer and more tactile feeling.<\/p>\n<p>We also looked at the motifs and asked ourselves how we could approach it in a more playful sense in order to inject fun into the whole experience.<\/p>\n<p>To tie the whole visual language together we decided upon an element that could be used through out &#8211; which was simply a smiley face.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5918\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/icongoraphy.png\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5918\" alt=\"Iconography\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/icongoraphy-1024x749.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Iconography<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Due to the nature of working in a cross discipline team with time constraints our focus was on making sure we had a smooth process that allowed the designers and developers to work more effectively and efficiently together. Using GitHub meant the developers avoided the pain of having to drag assets from the server to update the assets within the project and it was simple enough for the designers to use.<\/p>\n<p>The process worked was by producing an asset sheet for each section of the app, which was outputted using <a href=\"http:\/\/macrabbit.com\/slicy\/\">Slicy<\/a> to designated folders. Slicy was the perfect tool because once it was set up it featured recents + repeats which meant that any change to the original PSD automatically updated the assets. The next step of the process was to commit it to the repository via GitHub and to let the developers know that an update has been made \u2013 and hey presto we had the latest build.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/github.png\"><img class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-5919\" alt=\"github\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/github-1024x749.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Getting the concept into the product<\/h3>\n<p>Working to a tight time meant that we had to make some key decisions quickly including what elements from the initial direction we should or even could include in the finished product. An example was the decision whether we should create bespoke animation between the home page to the map results screen or add a key part of UX such as adding the next\/previous on the keyboard on the booking flow. We decided that the animation was not as vital to the product as making the best possible experience for the user.<\/p>\n<p>It was our goal to strike the right balance and make sure the product had all the features the business required as well as the right visual language and ideas we had in mind from the start of the process.<\/p>\n<p>Download the LateRooms.com app on <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.laterooms\">Android<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/laterooms.com-<br \/>\nhotel-booking\/id334701579?mt=8\">iPhone<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-5953\" alt=\"Finished\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/Finished-1024x749.png\" width=\"1024\" height=\"749\" \/><\/p>\n","date":"5 February 2014","link":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/blog\/laterooms\/","category":"Process","thumbnail":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/Workshop_capture.png","author":{"name":"ustwo","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6377f240550c05695407ee97ddad9a62?s=110&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D110&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-110 photo' height='110' width='110' \/>","description":""},"comments":{"items":[],"count":0},"social":{"tweets":"61","facebook":"11","plus":"3","total":75},"layout":{"categoryClass":"process"},"extraClasses":"blog__articles__item--hero"},{"id":5629,"title":"Bitcoin: Beyond the bubble","excerpt":"Bitcoin has recently captured the public\u2019s imagination in an unprecedented manner with its meteoric increase in price and high profile security breaches leaving many wondering whether this is a modern day Tulip mania.","content":"<p class=\"size-medium wp-image-5643\">Bitcoin, the digital cryptocurrency has recently captured the public&#8217;s imagination in an unprecedented manner. Most notably its meteoric increase in price and high profile security breaches have left many wondering whether this is a modern day <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tulip_mania\">Tulip mania<\/a>. The result of this has been twofold, it has drawn attention from individuals, investors, and entrepreneurs wanting to jump on the bandwagon along with further scrutiny from the media and international governments wondering how to approach the regulation of this new form of financial instrument.<\/p>\n<p>The conceptual elegance of Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralised architecture and democratic philosophy afford it the opportunity to become the native electronic currency in the age of interconnected devices. Bitcoin also offers an entry point for fresh &amp; disruptive thinking in an era where our incumbent financial institutions seek short term profit instead of supporting the needs of individuals and SMEs. However, before this vision is realised, Bitcoin needs to overcome some key friction points before it can reach mainstream adoption, as listed below.<\/p>\n<div>\n<dl id=\"attachment_5643\">\n<dt><a href=\"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/105644709@N08\/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/coins_medium-555x371.jpg\" width=\"555\" height=\"371\" \/><\/a><\/dt>\n<dd>Photo credit: Antana Coins on Flickr<\/dd>\n<\/dl>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Bitcoin is difficult to understand<\/h3>\n<p>Bitcoin is split into two sections conceptually. First up is the concept of \u2018a Bitcoin\u2019 as a unit of currency, and how it compares to the mental model of traditional FIAT money (any money declared by a government to be legal tender). One of the main stumbling blocks here is a matter of peculiar naming convention with \u2018one Bitcoin\u2019 not being the ideal base unit. Bitcoin is <a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/FAQ#How_divisible_are_bitcoins.3F\">highly divisible<\/a>, the problems is that fractions of a Bitcoin, unlike physical cash, don\u2019t currently have readily accessible names for smaller denomination units e.g. 10, 20, 50p.<\/p>\n<p>Second of all, understanding the process of \u2018mining\u2019 which in essence consists of many volunteer individuals (miners) who collectively dedicate and pool computing power to generate new Bitcoins. Additionally the process of verifying and confirming transactions in the Blockchain (the open source ledger where all transactions are logged), also carried out by miners in return for transaction fees.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5646\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/blog\/bitcoin-beyond-the-bubble\/single2_4_1\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5646\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5646\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/single2_4_1-555x536.jpg\" width=\"555\" height=\"536\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Buttefly Labs 5 GH\/s. One of many commercially available Bitcoin mining machines available on the market.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>These two aspects of Bitcoin are intrinsically linked. The latter aspect is particularly hard to grasp without having a fairly good grounding on the subject. Despite this, understanding how mining and the Blockchain work isn\u2019t essential knowledge for those wishing to use Bitcoin in a transactional sense. In this respect, Bitcoin\u2019s user experience could be greatly simplified by abstracting its transactional features into a more relatable model, akin to that of online banking to lower the learning curve for potential consumers.<\/p>\n<h3>High barrier of entry<\/h3>\n<p>Bitcoin is currently very difficult to buy. The current offering for individuals wishing to buy Bitcoin relies on using marketplaces or exchanges where there is ample opportunity for fraud and in some cases extremely lengthy and complex identity verification processes. This is one of the major hurdles Bitcoin currently faces. While many of these processes are in place to dissuade illicit activity, further simplification and improvement of security during entry experiences will go a long way in bolstering mainstream adoption.<\/p>\n<h3>Transactional complexity<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5670\" style=\"width: 224px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/blog\/bitcoin-beyond-the-bubble\/screen-shot-2013-11-27-at-09-13-30-5\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5670\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5670\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Screen-Shot-2013-11-27-at-09.13.304.png\" width=\"214\" height=\"209\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">An example QR code generated from the Bitcoin address shown above.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Currently, the transactional aspect of Bitcoin works on the basis of being able to transact sums of Bitcoin between two Bitcoin addresses, which are simply strings of 27-34 alphanumeric characters. E.g. 1757n7fia9o8kXT53zCSqYruUKR. These strings are the equivalent of email addresses, but are relatively unusable in their current guise. Some solutions have already surfaced in the form of visual QR codes, which can be scanned as a method of data entry. However, QR codes are still a long way from mainstream adoption, and therefore not quite the ideal solution to solve this problem.<\/p>\n<p>Another aspect of complexity with Bitcoin transactions is the application of transaction fees. Bitcoin has a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/wiki\/Transaction_fees\">well defined structure<\/a> for situations in which transaction fees should be levied, however, transaction fees are currently fixed regardless of the amount being transferred. Consequently, due to the escalating price of Bitcoin, even small micropayments could be penalised with a transaction fee which exceeds the payment itself. This anomaly is proving to be a large friction point in the adoption of Bitcoin as a micropayment platform. Bitcoin transaction policy is likely to still be under development, but if not addressed soon could lead to considerable confusion and prove to be detrimental to Bitcoin\u2019s uptake with individuals and merchants.<\/p>\n<h3>Security<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5677\" style=\"width: 138px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/blog\/bitcoin-beyond-the-bubble\/cube128-4\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5677\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5677\" alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/cube1283.png\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blockchain.info logo<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Any successful service utilising Bitcoin will need to match or exceed the security provided by competitors in order to gain the trust of consumers and gain credibility. Managing your Bitcoin requires taking a fairly large leap of faith in adopting one of the many wallet services. Recent headlines show just how vulnerable many wallet and exchange services are, leaving many out of pocket. Bitcoin wallet services draw many parallels with online banking\/payment portals. Given our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designweek.co.uk\/ustwo-works-with-barclays-on-mobile-to-mobile-banking-app\/3034054.article\">own experience<\/a> helping craft cutting edge mobile-based payment platforms, we understand the importance of providing high quality user experience and security provision for these services to succeed, but ultimately wallet services need to engender trust.<\/p>\n<p>Given that even the most established wallets are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.coindesk.com\/blockchain-info-issues-refunds-to-bitcoin-theft-victims\/\">still vulnerable<\/a> there is a clear need for a new industry benchmark to emerge.<\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>Bitcoin still is the preserve of the early adopters, but the tide is slowly turning. Part of driving adoption of Bitcoin for both individuals and businesses will rely in the creation of reliable &amp; secure services which attempt to address the issues mentioned above. Some notable examples where Bitcoin could radically change the landscape include the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>International money transfer (Retail banks, Western Union)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Payment processors (Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, American Express)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Reducing corruption through transparency (Banking, Government, Shadow economy)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Leveraging the advantages of Bitcoin<br \/>\n over the offerings of current digital services will also gain many businesses a competitive advantage and help Bitcoin trigger a network effect encouraging further adoption. Bitcoin\u2019s future lies in the hands of future thinking individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses wishing to use this disruptive new technology to change the way we think about, interact with and spend our money.<\/p>\n<h3>Further reading<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin <a href=\"https:\/\/en.bitcoin.it\/\">Wiki<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The original <a href=\"http:\/\/bitcoin.org\/bitcoin.pdf\">Bitcoin white paper<\/a> by Satoshi Nakamoto<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin articles in <a href=\"http:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/bitcoin\/\">TechCrunch<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin articles in The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.economist.com\/topics\/bitcoins\">Economist<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n","date":"28 November 2013","link":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/blog\/bitcoin-beyond-the-bubble\/","category":"Business","thumbnail":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/coins_medium.jpg","author":{"name":"ustwo","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6377f240550c05695407ee97ddad9a62?s=110&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D110&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-110 photo' height='110' width='110' \/>","description":""},"comments":{"items":[{"author":{"name":"larsrose","email":"lars.rosengren@gmail.com","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=110' class='avatar avatar-110 photo avatar-default' height='110' width='110' \/>"},"content":"I think the challenge with Bitcoin at present is that its wrestling both with practical and philosophical challenges.

So I\u2019m here to help us grow with that top of mind always.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/blog\/so-wtf-is-an-md-in-london-going-to-be-about\/ustwolondon_nov_2013_05\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5583\"><img src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/ustwoLondon_Nov_2013_05-555x406.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"ustwoLondon_Nov_2013_05\" width=\"555\" height=\"406\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5583\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>The Future<\/h3>\n<p>So what does the future look like? No idea! None of us have a crystal ball, and the pace of innovation is ridiculous right now, everyone is trying to keep on top of things, but we do have a few key advantages right now. If you&#8217;re in the digital design space for any time at all you&#8217;ll have noted ustwo\u2122 as &#8220;tiger in the bushes&#8221; for a few years now. For a highly profitable and rapidly growing studio we are remarkably less motivated by the money than by doing great work and making ustwo\u2122 a great place to be.<\/p>\n<p>If you add our long-standing focus on experimenting with our own products, and increasingly moving into the ventures area, then you&#8217;ve got something really special. ustwo\u2122 is a great mix of breakthrough thinking and getting things done, and that&#8217;s what you need now and ongoing, whether it&#8217;s client work or a venture. We are ambitious, sure, we want to take on the world, but it&#8217;s not about growth for its own sake. Ultimately this is a brilliant, passionate, learning team, and we are good to work with. Our clients and venture partners tell us that, and that\u2019s gold.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/blog\/so-wtf-is-an-md-in-london-going-to-be-about\/ustwolondon_nov_2013_02\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5580\"><img src=\"http:\/\/ustwo.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/ustwoLondon_Nov_2013_02-555x370.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"ustwoLondon_Nov_2013_02\" width=\"555\" height=\"370\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5580\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>We are going to build on what&#8217;s already there and we\u2019re ambitious enough to take things to a new level. We&#8217;ve got a platform to continue experimenting with developing our own IP, and that means we&#8217;ll continue to launch both our own products and do ventures with clients and partners. There&#8217;s a lot of ground-breaking client work under the hood, and we want to continue to grow that through being proactive and useful, but it&#8217;s certainly not just about fees for hours anymore. We want to be the &#8220;go to&#8221; for any design challenge, and I think that&#8217;s a great thing to continue striving for. We just want great work out there in the hands of humans, stuff that makes a difference. Design is a force for good, and we want to do good.<\/p>\n<p>Very pumped to be part of what\u2019s next.<\/p>\n","date":"14 November 2013","link":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/blog\/so-wtf-is-an-md-in-london-going-to-be-about\/","category":"Business","thumbnail":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Large2.jpg","author":{"name":"ustwo","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6377f240550c05695407ee97ddad9a62?s=110&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D110&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-110 photo' height='110' width='110' \/>","description":""},"comments":{"items":[],"count":0},"social":{"tweets":"4","facebook":"11","plus":"1","total":16},"layout":{"categoryClass":"business"},"extraClasses":""},{"id":5417,"title":"Conceiving the Future - the ustwo approach","excerpt":"If you're lucky enough to have numerous ideas for new customer products and services, you may find that selecting the best ones to move ahead with can be a more challenging process than you initially thought.\n\nMikael discusses the importance of having a cohesive strategy in place and demonstrates how we recently helped Sk\u00e5netrafiken achieve that vision through a series of collaborative work exercises.\n\n","content":"<p>When you have a pool of ideas for customer products and services, it can be difficult making sure you move ahead with the best ones.<\/p>\n<p>We recently helped <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sk%C3%A5netrafiken\">Sk\u00e5netrafiken<\/a>, the public transport supplier of southern Sweden, make this decision by pulling together a cross functional team (including the client) and running through a series of lean UX exercises with a <a href=\"www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/jfdi-so-many-words-so-little-time\/\">JFDI<\/a> mindset.<\/p>\n<p>This process was extremely valuable to the client, creating some great concepts, as well as exploring new ways of looking at future business opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We always advocate tight collaboration with our clients to maintain maximum momentum and creative output when it comes to projects.

So to start this process it\u2019s best to begin with a clean slate by deliberately forgetting (not forever) all previously discussed ideas and instead think about how the organization should serve its customer differently in the future. By agreeing on a direction or vision you will have a guide to base all future decisions going forward.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve an aligned direction with the team at Sk\u00e5netrafiken we organised a pre-meeting with a stakeholder group in order to get their input towards the vision of the project.<\/p>\n<p>This vision was the starting point we used to kick off the lean UX exercises with the cross functional team. It was a highly interactive phase where both ustwo\u2122 and Sk\u00e5netrafiken jointly set out the direction for the project and its desired outcomes. In essence we explored how public transport would and could serve it customers in the future.<\/p>\n<p>To define the vision further, it\u2019s important to agree on what success is. How will you know you have succeeded? Define how these criteria for success will be measured and then make sure they are prioritized in order of importance.<\/p>\n<h3>Exercise: Define Desired Outcomes (one hour)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>On post it notes, each team member writes down the differences expected to be achieved after delivering the output over time.<\/li>\n<li>Organize team members into groups of 3-6 people by mixing designers and clients in each group.<\/li>\n<li>Ask each group to organize their post it notes into common themes.<\/li>\n<li>Each group presents their themes.<\/li>\n<li>Prioritize the themes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/conceptualizing-the-future-the-ustwo-approach\/st_blogimage1-2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5430\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/ST_Blogimage11-555x299.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"ST_Blogimage1\" width=\"555\" height=\"299\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5430\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Know your customers<\/h3>\n<p>Do you know who your customers are? Post a short description of your user types up on a wall for everyone to focus on. Select the user types (1-5 personas) you think potentially will contribute the most to your vision.

Acting out is encouraged.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In essence what you have now is a set of prioritized ideas mapped to user journeys that together form the basis of one or more product or service. These can easily be translated into future-gazing scenarios.<\/p>\n<p>After working through the above exercises in a cross functional team, we found that selecting the best ideas for Sk\u00e5netrafiken was surprisingly easy, as each member was now aligned in thinking. This is one of the key reasons why workshops are so efficient &#8211; moving through many stages of the project in short time with a cross-company and cross-functional team reduces the overhead of summarizing and briefing.<\/p>\n<h3>Get your organization excited about the future<\/h3>\n<p>To help people outside the cross-functional team and in the organization as a whole understand the ideas and their purpose, you\u2019ll need to find appropriate ways to communicate them. Be creative, make it visual. For example an image, a prototype, a video or a storyboard. Put the customer using the product at the centre of it all and show the value the service brings to them. In an upcoming blog post, we\u2019ll tell you more about how we decided to communicate the ideas generated from the Sk\u00e5netrafiken project.<\/p>\n<h3>Next &#8211; act on your vision<\/h3>\n<p>To be honest, what you have now is a hypothesis. A hypothesis about what products and services your customers will appreciate and that will lead to success for the organization. This hypothesis needs to be validated by iterating a \u201cBuild &#8211; Measure &#8211; Learn\u201d loop. It\u2019s all about  prototyping and testing it with your customers to learn and adjust accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>You can get a long way towards reaching your goals in just one workshop!<\/p>\n","date":"3 October 2013","link":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/blog\/conceptualizing-the-future-the-ustwo-approach\/","category":"Process","thumbnail":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/ST_Blogimage1.png","author":{"name":"ustwo","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6377f240550c05695407ee97ddad9a62?s=110&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D110&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-110 photo' height='110' width='110' \/>","description":""},"comments":{"items":[],"count":0},"social":{"tweets":"20","facebook":"0","plus":"6","total":26},"layout":{"categoryClass":"process"},"extraClasses":""},{"id":5369,"title":"How do you distil 3 ustwo studios down in to one fresh holiday cocktail?","excerpt":"The two London wizards of Studio Management, Jane and Matthew take a look back at some of the highlights of this years ustwo\u2122 summer holiday in Croatia and from a logistics perspective, the difficulties in bringing together 135 ustwobies from different countries.","content":"<p> The summer holiday has been part of the ustwo\u2122 experience from the very beginning. In previous years, the ever-expanding holidays have taken us to Wales, Cornwall, Fiskecampe in the south of Sweden (so nice we did it twice!) and, last year, Cascais in Portugal. 2013 marked the next generation of ustwo\u2122 summer holidays. After nine years bringing together London and Malm\u00f6, we had the added ingredient of our shiny New York studio in the mix. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5400\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/how-do-you-distil-3-ustwo-studios-down-in-to-one-fresh-holiday-cocktail\/garden_tisno-aerial\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5400\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/garden_tisno-aerial-555x387.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"garden_tisno aerial\" width=\"555\" height=\"387\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5400\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aerial view of Rastovac resort near Tisno<\/p><\/div>\n<p> The holiday is eagerly and not so patiently awaited as a time to unite ustwo\u2122 brothers and sisters for their once-a-year opportunity for true togetherness, in a blissful location to soak up some Fampany vibes. The holiday is a singular event in the company calendar that crystallises the true sense of Fampany. <\/p>\n<h3> ustwo\u2122 holiday 2013<\/h3>\n<p> This year, Croatia became our home from home. Three studios, three nights; 135 night-swimming, flat-out sunbathing, bar and BBQ-hopping ustwobies took over Rastovac resort near Tisno. Not your average corporate knees-up, but a special few days of creative thinking and drinking together. Each year the theme is simple: spend quality time with your fellow ustwobies. Make new friends. Build strong bonds and most of all, have an amazing time because you deserve it. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5393\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/how-do-you-distil-3-ustwo-studios-down-in-to-one-fresh-holiday-cocktail\/img_1352-2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5393\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/IMG_13521-555x369.jpg\" alt=\"Bow\" title=\"IMG_1352\" width=\"555\" height=\"369\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5393\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bow shot of HMS ustwo\u2122<\/p><\/div>\n<p> From our point of view in the organisational committee (our very own ustwo\u2122 \u2018culture club\u2019), we knew that this year was going to be a bigger fish to fry than our previous successful holidays. Portugal was going to be hard to top, so we had to pull out all the stops to make sure Croatia was blowing any previous holiday experiences out of the water. We had a huge undertaking on our hands: 135 attendees flying out from several different countries, finding accommodation to fit us all, and trying to ensure that all ustwobies with different interests and outlooks had a brilliant time together, no matter what. <\/p>\n<h3> The Power of Music<\/h3>\n<p> The solution to the problem was simple though. MUSIC. A common theme that seems to run through all ustwo holidays is the one essential tool with which to bring everyone together. We equipped a group of our budding ustwo DJs with the set up they needed at the ustwo\u2122 beach bar, situated overlooking a beautiful Croatian cove and distant islands, and let them run the show. With music flows beer, eclectic dance moves, laughing, singing, hugging and an instant physical and emotional connection between the group. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5396\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/how-do-you-distil-3-ustwo-studios-down-in-to-one-fresh-holiday-cocktail\/croatia2013_12-resize\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5396\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/croatia2013_12-resize-555x370.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"croatia2013_12 resize\" width=\"555\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5396\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Disco, disco, disco<\/p><\/div>\n<p> The ustwo\u2122 holiday includes everyone, and we took seriously the potential to help create lasting bonds across the three studios. A handful of wide-eyed recent hires joined us, including one whose very first day began at Gatwick. There\u2019s nothing like being thrown in at the deep end. <\/p>\n<h3> The ustwo\u2122 Olympics<\/h3>\n<p> Our holiday presented the opportunity for some friendly competition amongst ustwobie teams. With the teams in place, we took a leap of faith and entered everyone into a \u201custwo\u2122 Olympics\u201d where teams could race it out in three legged or flip flop relays to win the all important points at the end. It may have taken 40 minutes to raise enough gusto in our hung-over ustwobies to take part, but once the teams were lined up for the first race &#8211; you couldn\u2019t hold back those who wanted to bring glory to their team. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5387\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/how-do-you-distil-3-ustwo-studios-down-in-to-one-fresh-holiday-cocktail\/img_1180\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5387\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/10\/IMG_1180-555x416.jpg\" alt=\"Tug of war\" title=\"IMG_1180\" width=\"555\" height=\"416\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5387\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ultimate tug of war<\/p><\/div>\n<p> We couldn\u2019t round off team sports without a Tug of War for the winners, and for the unfortunate losing teams, a nomination, or sacrifice, was made for the Chubby Bunny victim.

From \u2018Tech City\u2019, where the campaign originated, to Silicon Valley - its many supporters share in the conviction that design matters in education.\n\nJoe was asked by The National Society for Education in Art and Design (NSEAD), the leading national authority concerned with art, craft and design across all phases of education in the United Kingdom, to write an article for its member's magazine (AD Magazine), explaining how and why the campaign came about .","content":"<p>In November last year we read an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/education\/2012\/nov\/02\/arts-leaders-concerns-ebacc-schools\">article<\/a> by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/uk\">the Guardian<\/a> on the new <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/English_Baccalaureate\">Ebacc qualification<\/a> and how it would effectively remove creative subjects from core education. The article focused on the high arts, and the impact removing creative subjects would have on education.<\/p>\n<p>From our perspective as designers, there was little mention in the article about the long-term potential impact on the design industry, as well as the UK economy as a whole. It seemed that the all too familiar battle lines had been drawn between academic and creative subjects. A focus on traditional academic subjects ostracizes those who fail to excel, offering no opportunity to explore other more creative areas of study.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately this is further compounded for those with learning difficulties. On a personal level, I found out quite late (21), that I was profoundly dyslexic. Despite this and because of design, I\u2019ve luckily had a successful career from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csm.arts.ac.uk\/\">St Martins<\/a>, RCA, Oyster (now called LBi), Orange, Nokia and now ustwo\u2122.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the anti creative subject mindset can discourage interest in pursuing employment in creative industries all together &#8211; something which concerned us so much, that we decided to do something about it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5234\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-include-design-campaign-round-up\/includedesign_logo\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5234\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/includedesign_logo-555x83.png\" alt=\"Include Design logo\" title=\"includedesign_logo\" width=\"555\" height=\"83\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5234\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Include Design Logo<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Building momentum<\/h3>\n<p>We didn&#8217;t know much about politics or campaigning, but we used our networking skills to grow a digital audience, as well as set up a <a href=\"http:\/\/includedesign.org\/\">website<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/includedesign\">Twitter<\/a> account. Our first mission was to simply write a letter to Michael Gove (the Secretary of State) on behalf of like-minded companies in and around \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/techcity.io\/\">Tech City<\/a>\u2019 &#8211; the digital area around London\u2019s Shoreditch &#8211; expressing our collective concerns.<\/p>\n<p>We quickly built momentum within the industry and by the end of the first week, we had numerous local digital companies involved, as well as the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designcouncil.org.uk\/\">Design Council<\/a>, Terrence Conran, Wayne Hemmingway, Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby. Our approach naturally changed as interest grew, and we found ourselves in the rarified position to be able send a letter on behalf of the design industry as a whole &#8211; a far bigger group than initially intended.<\/p>\n<p>By week three the campaign was on fire, with the cream of the design world behind it. Just when we thought it could not get better, and literally days before we were due to send our letter, we heard some exciting news that some significant leaders of the industry had committed their support including Jonathan Ive, Stella McCartney and Lord Foster.<\/p>\n<p>So with over 300 design companies and individuals backing the Include Design campaign, we sent our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.digitalartsonline.co.uk\/news\/creative-business\/uk-design-industry-tells-michael-gove-put-design-into-ebacc\/\">letter<\/a> to Michael Gove. We also reached out to the trade press who helped generate more noise surrounding the campaign, resulting in many more interested parties committing to the cause.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5237\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-include-design-campaign-round-up\/ebacc-5-medium\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5237\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/EBACC-5-Medium-555x375.jpg\" alt=\"Downing Street\" title=\"EBACC 5 (Medium)\" width=\"555\" height=\"375\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5237\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From Left to Right - ustwo&#039;s Joe Macleod , Kathryn James from National Association of Head Teachers, Marilyn Harrop from The National Union of Teachers and Deborah Annetts the co-ordinator of the baccforthefuture campaign<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Sustaining interest<\/h3>\n<p>Our aim was to sustain interest in the campaign, so we came up with various initiatives to help us achieve that goal. One example was something called \u20186 minutes for creativity\u2019. We asked our supporters to dedicate 6 minutes at 11am on the 21st December to raise awareness of creative subjects being excluded from core education. This was highly successful generating lots of press interest and even saw us trending on Twitter. Throughout January the campaign continued to grow.<\/p>\n<p>On the 6th February, I heard some great <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/education\/educationnews\/9854520\/Michael-Goves-GCSE-U-turn-how-EBacc-was-scrapped.html\">news<\/a>. Michael Gove was to announce a U-turn the following morning in the House of Commons. That day he backed down from his proposals on the Ebacc and re-established creative subjects within core education &#8211; this was a massive victory for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Following this our approach shifted from raising awareness of the campaign, to focusing on ways of improving the design curriculum. So in partnership with the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.designcouncil.org.uk\">Design Council<\/a><\/a>, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.data.org.uk\/\">Design &#038; Technology Association<\/a> and the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesorrellfoundation.com\/\">Sorrell Foundation<\/a>, we\u2019ve been working hard, re-writing parts of the curriculum as well as advising on the elements that the Design industry would be expecting from it.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5248\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-include-design-campaign-round-up\/includedesign_6mins_poster_croped-3\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5248\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/09\/includedesign_6mins_poster_croped2-390x555.jpg\" alt=\"\u20186 minutes for creativity\u2019\" title=\"includedesign_6mins_poster_croped\" width=\"390\" height=\"555\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5248\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\u20186 minutes for creativity\u2019 initiative<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Ongoing improvement<\/h3>\n<p>Speaking with experience of recruiting around four designers a month, I know for a fact we need to improve design education. The future quality in any national curriculum has to be driven and benchmarked by competition internationally, as this will keep standards as high as possible. It\u2019s this market that will challenge our relationship with paper qualifications, curriculum content, distance learning and design processes.<\/p>\n<p>This period of much needed self-reflection for design education, is the perfect starting point to assemble a better, more rigorous curriculum. There are of course enormous challenges ahead, but I have been genuinely humbled by the speed and passion in which the industry has rallied behind this important issue.<\/p>\n<p>Design should be a corner stone of our national curriculum for one crucial reason. Where academic subjects encourage pupils to coldly recall information, design permits pupils to think confidently about the unknowns of the world &#8211; ultimately creating visionaries of the future who can apply design process and thinking to a diverse range of problems.<\/p>\n<p><em>This article originally appeared in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nsead.org\/publications\/ad.aspx\">AD<\/a> issue #8, the NSEAD members&#8217; magazine.

It was a truly exciting project to be involved with &#8211; we had a blank canvas to build something from scratch, a global team of best in class collaborators and a client who lived and breathed our <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/jfdi-so-many-words-so-little-time\/\">JFDI<\/a> approach.<\/p>\n<p> We kicked off the project with a focus on entrepreneurs, and from this developed initial ideas for a service designed to help them run their businesses more efficiently. During early prototyping it became important that we defined exactly how the brand should be represented within the design.<\/p>\n<p>The brand was in the process of being developed by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.michaelwolff.eu.com\">Michael Wolff<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nbstudio.co.uk\/\">NB Studio<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/daljit.tumblr.com\/\">Daljit Singh<\/a>, so together we began exploring what it might look and feel like as part of a digital service. The digital brand had to be simple and easy enough for anyone to understand. The service was therefore named KNOPKA meaning button.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5139\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/infusing-brand-spirit-into-the-ui-of-knopka\/knopka-timeline-desktop\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5139\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Knopka-Timeline-desktop.png\" alt=\"KNOPKA timeline\" title=\"Knopka-Timeline-desktop\" width=\"555\" height=\"370\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5139\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A desktop view of KNOPKA&#039;s user timeline<\/p><\/div>\n<p>KNOPKA\u2019s brand visual identity consisted of simple buttons, the Futura font and a rich palette of colours &#8211; kept flat, yet iconic. To mirror this, the UI design was stripped down removing unnecessary information, but it soon became clear that conveying the unique KNOPKA brand spirit through something so flat and simple would be challenging. To help us capture both an emotive experience and sense of brand \u2018magic\u2019, we brought together Michael Wolff, NB Studio and Daljit Singh for a one day emotive UI exploration workshop.<\/p>\n<h3>UI personality workshop<\/h3>\n<p>To begin with, we started discussing some examples of magical moments in life (like your first kiss or the smell of fresh coffee), and how these might translate into digital expressions. We then explored how the spirit of KNOPKA might manifest itself as a real character, for example a little cheeky girl, a faithful dog or a loving aunt.<\/p>\n<p>The focus was not on what they looked like physically, but instead how they might behave or act in certain situations from sign in, to sharing news or displaying an error message. Throughout the process the different characters we came up with all consisted of unique elements that personified the core brand experience, but none of them captured the KNOPKA\u2019ness we wanted within the UI.<\/p>\n<p>After considering various options, it finally struck us that it was not a person or animal we were looking for, but instead the lovable <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/R2-D2\">R2-D2<\/a> from Star Wars. His characteristics matched the overall brand experience in all manners with key attributes including playfulness, loyalty, efficiency, cheekiness, trustworthiness, problem solving skills, message carrying, etc.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5136\" style=\"width: 559px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/infusing-brand-spirit-into-the-ui-of-knopka\/knopka-r2d2\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5136\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Knopka-r2d2-549x555.gif\" alt=\"R2 - D2\" title=\"Knopka-r2d2\" width=\"549\" height=\"555\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5136\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A sketch of R2-D2 highlighting key character attributes<\/p><\/div>\n<p>So with a character in mind, we sketched out some ideas in order to capture the spirit of R2-D2, and ways in which we could go about incorporating elements of this into the UI.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5135\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/infusing-brand-spirit-into-the-ui-of-knopka\/knopka-elementssketches\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5135\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Knopka-ElementsSketches.gif\" alt=\"KNOPKA elements\" title=\"Knopka-ElementsSketches\" width=\"555\" height=\"275\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5135\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Key elements sketched out<\/p><\/div>\n<p>After the workshop we immediately began experimenting with different motion and interaction patterns, as well as sound effects to identify how best to represent R2-D2\u2019s unique personality throughout the UI.<\/p>\n<h3>Bringing icons to life<\/h3>\n<p>Since the UI was icon focused we really wanted to bring them to life with that extra KNOPKA character, and we did this by giving them their own individual animations. For example, the login button\u2019s key icon spins when pressed, the money icon sparkles and the accountant icon blinks. This was a playful, subtle and engaging way of bringing some magic into the experience.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5138\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/infusing-brand-spirit-into-the-ui-of-knopka\/knopka-hovericons\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5138\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Knopka-HoverIcons.gif\" alt=\"KNOPKA icons\" title=\"Knopka-HoverIcons\" width=\"555\" height=\"70\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5138\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">KNOPKA icons with motion and a touch of character<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Emotion through motion<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s no better way to express what\u2019s going on in a UI than using motion design.

It\u2019s similar to when R2D2 shuffles from side to side making his distinctive sound when he\u2019s upset.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_5150\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/infusing-brand-spirit-into-the-ui-of-knopka\/knopka-loginerror\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5150\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Knopka-LoginError.gif\" alt=\"KNOPKA login error\" title=\"Knopka-LoginError\" width=\"555\" height=\"350\" class=\"size-full wp-image-5150\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Login error screen with motion<\/p><\/div>\n<h3>Guiding the user through animations<\/h3>\n<p>Something we value highly here is making sure a user really understands where they\u2019re navigating to, where they came from, and even more importantly, where the things they\u2019ve created end up within the UI.

Mikael Lindh therefore decided to take a look at three industry lies (well myths) to get the conversation going.","content":"<p>The theme at Media Evolution&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/mediaevolution.se\/theconference\">The Conference 2013<\/a> is &#8220;Power, Disruption and Lies&#8221; (inspired by New Order&#8217;s album).\n<p>The Media Evolution team invited us to get involved by writing a blog post around this year&#8217;s theme. I&#8217;ve therefore decided to take a look at three industry lies (well myths) to get the conversation going.\n<p>The process of digital product creation is evolving so quickly that approaches we used a year or two ago are already verging on being redundant. We therefore thought we\u2019d compile a list of things that we believe have changed, as well as suggest a shift in perspective designed to face the challenges of future digital product creation.<\/p>\n<p>\n<h3>Myth 1: More upfront research = less risk<\/h3>\n<p>\n<p>Betting too much on knowledge gained early in a project is very risky. Even if you have THE big idea, things always change. An example of this is the Scandinavian bank SEB. It was recently reported that SEB \u2018wasted\u2019 millions developing an internet bank service that was never used. How could this happen? They had done their research. In 2006 they conducted extensive research and requirements gathering activities to prepare them for the future of banking. In 2007 the iPhone arrived, and shortly after the concept of mobile banking (something inconceivable on 2006\u2019s mobile devices). Unfortunately SEB\u2019s new internet banking system could not effectively support mobile banking without further substantial investment. SEB eventually decided to kill the project 5 years later, with an <a title=\"Article about SEB\" href=\"http:\/\/computersweden.idg.se\/2.2683\/1.489832\/seb-skrotar-ny-natbank---750-miljoner-i-sjon\">estimated loss of 750 million Swedish crowns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\n<p>Obviously this is an extreme case. However all projects have hidden risks associated to unforeseen changes in markets or industries. To minimize risk, we believe in conducting enough research to formulate hypotheses for project success. We then test these hypotheses, reformulate them and test again. We are not afraid to kill ideas that do not work. We are not suggesting less research, but rather a continual iterative research approach that can run in parallel to other activities. If SEB had taken a similar approach, they would have been more responsive to change.<\/p>\n<p>\n<p>This summer we have been working closely with Sk\u00e5netrafiken, the public transport supplier of southern Sweden. Instead of an extensive research phase we facilitated a series of Lean UX workshops. We helped distil their many different ideas and directions into a set of prioritized hypotheses. These hypotheses are now ready to be tested and refined together with their users with minimal risk.<\/p>\n<p>\n<h3>Myth 2: More fuel makes an engine go faster<\/h3>\n<p>\n<p>It is a common mistake to believe adding more people will speed up a project. This is a lie (Well sort of.) Bigger teams can get things done quicker, but not proportionally. If you have a project that takes a team 10 weeks to design and develop, doubling the team will not ensure that the project is completed five weeks earlier. With the introduction of each new member, the need for greater co-ordination and communication multiplies. Add to this that it is more difficult to foster a culture of ownership and that bigger teams are less responsive to changes in direction, and the benefit of \u201cthrowing in\u201d a couple of extra people is vastly reduced in a project that is striving to be agile.<\/p>\n<p>\n<p>This is why we like to keep our teams small. Initially we work in small teams to create a minimum viable product. Later we scale the team organically based on project needs and with the aim of always retaining the commitment to the final product. A clear example of this is our disruptive photo sharing service Rando. It was built by a two-person team over the course of a few weeks and has to date transported more than 12.5 million randos between completely random users. The team owned the product from start to finish and the feature-set was entirely focused around the minimum viable product. <a title=\"Rando site\" href=\"http:\/\/rando.ustwo.se\/\">Download Rando and see what a two person team achieved in just a few weeks.<\/a><\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5064\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/3-myths-of-digital-product-creation\/rando_3_platforms\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5064\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5064\" title=\"Rando_3_platforms\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Rando_3_platforms-555x234.jpg\" alt=\"Rando\" width=\"555\" height=\"234\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">From idea to app in a few weeks<\/p><\/div><br \/>\n<h3>Myth 3: Knowing \u201cAgile\u201d equals success<\/h3>\n<p>\n<p>This is not true. Stop hiding behind process, methods and tools! Even though we are huge fans of Agile, Scrum and Lean we believe other factors are more important when it comes to creating success. Dig deeper! You&#8217;ll need a group of passionate people who care about each other and the projects they work with. It needs to be a genuine value of your organization. It&#8217;s not just about &#8220;implementing Agile&#8221;. If two assholes read the same book about Agile, they will still be assholes.<\/p>\n<p>\n<p>Focus on people over processes and tools. This is ironically a cornerstone of the Agile manifesto that is commonly overlooked. At ustwo we believe motivated people can work with minimal management. Rather than having project managers chasing deliverables, we use team coaches to oil the machine and make sure the engine runs smoothly. Focus on HOW the team works together instead of WHAT the team is delivering.<\/p>\n<p>We invest in our unique culture known as Fampany (family + company). Fampany is about caring for each other, but also being passionate about what we do. It is a culture of empowerment and ownership that manifests itself in our uniquely crafted digital products. We believe this is the foundation of our success.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_5057\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/3-myths-of-digital-product-creation\/studio\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5057\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5057\" title=\"Studio\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/08\/Studio-555x341.jpg\" alt=\"Fampany\" width=\"555\" height=\"341\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fampany<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Do you agree?

Combined with general market research, we uncovered three \u201cpersonalities\u201d that best describe this mid to late twenties group.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The Free-Spirited Shopper<\/strong>\u2014lives in the moment by buying goods for herself and others.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Practical Bohemian<\/strong>\u2014spends limited amount of money on finer cultural &amp; health experiences.<\/li>\n<li><strong>The Budgeted Playboy<\/strong>\u2014careful spender, but likes showing off new-found wealth to others.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What do the three have in common? They\u2019re not big savers. Perhaps the greatest differentiator from past generations is the evolved perception of what it means to invest. An investment to a Gen Y\u2019er is pair of designer shoes that will wear well for 5 years, demonstrate their suave style, and boot their social self-esteem. It\u2019s the generation most likely to invest in travel \u2013 a trip to Croatia with 12 buddies will \u201cshape their life experience\u201d and promise memories that can\u2019t be replaced (and Gen Y\u2019ers looooove life experiences).<\/p>\n<p>Research shows Gen Y likes to live in the moment and spends money on their immediate well-being. They enjoy sharing experiences with others and will look to others for guidance when they are uncertain about a financial decision. Although digitally savvy and experts on buying online\/offline, Gen-Yers are not early adopters of technology and are also the biggest group that visit brick &amp; mortar bank branches and call centers. They feel comfortable and confident in their spending habits, but the majority of this group is financially illiterate (<a href=\"http:\/\/usatoday30.usatoday.com\/money\/perfi\/basics\/story\/2012-04-23\/millenials-financial-knowledge\/54494856\/1\" target=\"_blank\">The cost of financial illiteracy<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>Gen-Y Financial Application Opportunities<\/h3>\n<p>All things considered, where do we see opportunities for financial groups when creating value products for Gen-Y? As opposed to building another iteration of the mobile wallet, we see more market growth opportunities in the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creating a recommendation system that\u2019s not in your face, but instead encourages behavior in line with the customers\u2019 goals. Banks will do well to get to know their customer\u2019s goals.<\/li>\n<li>Increase the feeling of security and control. While Gen Yers like to have auto-pay systems in place, they still prefer to be the command center. Gen Y\u2019ers want to push the \u201cpay\u201d button. Even if reminders are implemented, build systems around the concept of customer control.<\/li>\n<li>Create a unified platform for group expenses and transactions. Gen Y\u2019ers like to share. Offering a tool that brings visibility to group expenses and provides a platform for peer to peer payment will go far with this group.<\/li>\n<li>Umbrella financial services, offering many targeted services\u2014from taxes and business solutions to insurance and personal lifestyle. Remember this group is \u201cfinancially illiterate.\u201d The more supported they feel, the more likely they are to use services offered.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Final Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>So is digitizing your business going to get you Gen-Y customers? It might help, but it\u2019s unlikely to build long\u2013term relationships. Creating an application for monitoring personal finances is a great starting point, but business should consider getting to know their potential users and implementing features catered to user lifestyles, spending styles, and financial goals. <em><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Paul collaborated with Oylum Boran, Jaci Pearse and Pedro Sepulveda to run user research and create this post.

It was part <a title=\"Pecha Kucha\" href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PechaKucha\">Pecha Kucha<\/a>, part pep talk and part rant.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-world-according-to-gyppsy-the-industry-of-ideas\/title\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4751\"><img title=\"Title\" alt=\"The World According to Gyppsy \u2014 The Industry of Ideas\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Title.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Rather than let the presentation sit on Dropbox gathering virtual dust, I thought I\u2019d spin off some of what I mentioned into a series of blog posts. The first thing I\u2019d like to cover is one of my little rants: The Industry of Ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Few of us will have failed to notice the rise of startup culture over recent years, and with it a new bunch of buzzwords that appear in every related shallow-depth-of-field video that gets released: \u201cdisrupt\u201d, \u201cfail\u201d, \u201citerate\u201d, \u201clean\u201d etc.<\/p>\n<p>Personally it\u2019s the use of the two \u201ci\u201ds that\u2019s beginning to grate on me: ideas and inspiration. Let me explain\u2026<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s My Beef?<\/h3>\n<p>The media have understandably been keen to publicise startup success stories, with a constant stream of talking heads often giving the impression that all you need is an idea, plenty of hard work and an obligatory pivot or two before you become the next twenty-something billionaire.<\/p>\n<p>With this however comes a certain degree of pressure &#8211; as it can seem like everyone is doing it, so why aren\u2019t you? For those looking for their own success, the hard work part is obvious enough, but how do you get that killer idea in the first place? Off the back of that question have come a multitude of videos \/ podcasts \/ conferences \/ books, all giving the impression that they\u2019ll inspire you to do great things, to have that one idea. But does this content really help or is just playing on people\u2019s dreams and desires?<\/p>\n<p>My first query is the concept that ideas and inspiration can be packaged up and delivered in a conveniently bite sized video or blog post, and that by spending fifteen minutes of your time listening or reading them \u2014 a spark can be ignited.<\/p>\n<p>For me, it doesn\u2019t seem to work like this and that\u2019s not to dismiss this type of content completely, as a lot of it has some great value and insight. I think however, somewhere along the lines, the words \u2018inspirational\u2019 and \u2018interesting\u2019 have got muddled up. I\u2019ll often come away from watching a talk and think, \u201cthat was quite cool, didn\u2019t realise that\u201d, but then I\u2019ll just carry on with business as usual. How many of us can truly say that something we\u2019ve seen has really given us a jolt, made us get up and actually do something, or completely changed our lives?<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_4748\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-world-according-to-gyppsy-the-industry-of-ideas\/inspiration-procrastination\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4748\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4748\" title=\"Inspiration = Procrastination\" alt=\"Inspiration = Procrastination\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/Inspiration-Procrastination.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"396\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Inspiration = Procrastination<\/p><\/div>\n<p>To some extent you could argue that searching for inspiration is a form of procrastination. We\u2019re all guilty of sitting down to watch a TED talk, perceiving this as a more valuable use of our time and ultimately hoping this process is the catalyst for the much needed motivation we\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>But I struggle personally with the notion of relying on an external source to give me that drive; instead I\u2019m a firm believer in <a title=\"JFDI blog post\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/jfdi-so-many-words-so-little-time\/\">JFDI<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Another concern is that overall it feels like we\u2019re reaching complete and utter saturation. If you were to watch every video, read every book, and attend every talk, then the reality is there\u2019d be no time left to do anything else!<\/p>\n<h3>Where do my ideas and inspiration come from?<\/h3>\n<p>It goes without saying that during the process of writing this post, I inevitably had to ask myself where my ideas and inspiration come from, and although I can\u2019t give any definitive answers, I think I understand what makes a good breeding ground for them.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_4750\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-world-according-to-gyppsy-the-industry-of-ideas\/the-jfdi-conference\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4750\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4750\" title=\"The JFDI Conference\" alt=\"The JFDI Conference\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/The-JFDI-Conference.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"555\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The JFDI Conference \u2014 open to everyone<\/p><\/div>\n<p>First of all: hard work. Success isn\u2019t built overnight, but neither are ideas. Having read <a title=\"Outliers\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell\/dp\/0141036257\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372193843&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=outliers\">Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell<\/a> a few years ago (whilst on holiday may I add, so technically I wasn\u2019t procrastinating) I\u2019m now starting to see the logic in his 10,000 hours theory (at the time I was probably only up to 7\u20138,000). Do something repetitively, get good at it and that way you\u2019ll see areas for improvement and how you can refine or revolutionise them.<\/p>\n<p>When that time comes, you\u2019ll have the knowledge and experience to realise what you\u2019re on to, and most importantly make the most of it. I\u2019ve been able to draw parallels with this thinking from my own career, and having worked for years learning the art of pixel perfect design, I realised that there was no real guidance out there to help young aspiring designers on these specific details. From that need, the <a title=\"The ustwo\u2122 Pixel Perfect Precision Handbook 2\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-ustwo-pixel-perfect-precision-handbook-2\/\">Pixel Perfect Precision Handbook<\/a> came in to being, something that wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the years of experience beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly: variety. Take an interest in topics and activities outside your field as this gives you a broader range of references and knowledge. Steve Jobs sums it up beautifully for me:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cCreativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn\u2019t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That\u2019s because they were able to connect experiences they\u2019ve had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they\u2019ve had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_4749\" style=\"width: 565px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/blog\/the-world-according-to-gyppsy-the-industry-of-ideas\/the-idea-factory\/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4749\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4749\" title=\"The Idea Factory\" alt=\"Idea Factory\" src=\"http:\/\/www.ustwo.co.uk\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/The-Idea-Factory.png\" width=\"555\" height=\"418\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A ready-made idea factory<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Lastly: put the bloody phone down\u2026 Stop being over-stimulated and do something boring. It\u2019s great to chuck all this knowledge and experience into your head, but like a good beer, it all needs time to ferment. The classic location for a brainwave for me is in the shower, as there\u2019s no external distraction your mind has time to wander and think about random things. If you\u2019re lucky those things may connect. In my case, I\u2019ve had some great i<br \/>\ndeas whilst doing the washing up, or mowing the lawn (pixel perfect edges of course). So next time you\u2019re waiting for the bus, rather than pull out your phone and jump onto Facebook or Twitter, spend a little time daydreaming. Trust me, it works.<\/p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>The problem with pontificating about anything like this is that it\u2019s so speculative because we\u2019re all so different, that it\u2019s impossible to come up with some one-size-fits-all solution in terms of advice. For some, indulging in the world of inspiration may well produce some amazing ideas, but I wanted to provide a counterpoint for people such as myself who don\u2019t work like that, and to that extent I hope this has been of some help.<\/p>\n","date":"25 July 2013","link":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/blog\/the-world-according-to-gyppsy-the-industry-of-ideas\/","category":"Culture","thumbnail":"http:\/\/ustwo.localhost\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/06\/The-JFDI-Conference.png","author":{"name":"ustwo","avatar":"<img alt='' src='http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/6377f240550c05695407ee97ddad9a62?s=110&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D110&amp;r=G' class='avatar avatar-110 photo' height='110' width='110' \/>","description":""},"comments":{"items":[],"count":0},"social":{"tweets":"18","facebook":"11","plus":"5","total":34},"layout":{"categoryClass":"culture"},"extraClasses":""}],"number":"55"},"searchString":false}
