A couple of the points that Joel mention was heavily debated the recent Bitcoin expo in London. \n\n\nThe idealists argue for Bitcoin being completely unregulated and under the radar of goverments, the realists argue that transparency and regulation is necessary for widespread adoption. Although not an expert on the topic, I think regulation would probably fundamentally stifle the concept of bitcoin, whereas transparency to a point is required to gain trust amongst the public. \n\n\nThe price volatility is quite natural as it concerns the perceptual value of something that has only been traded for a short time, lacks standardised market place and is conceptually difficult to understand and predict the future for.

Immensely enjoyable. \n\nThe key question I have with all of this is who actually owns Bitcoin and what (if any) bodies exist to regulate the currency? How can you apply monetary or fiscal policy on a currency that is essentially owned by no one, nor a particular unified body have a vested interest in or mandate to ensure the peaks and troughs in exchange rates are helped smoothed?\n\nCurrently, the volatility of Bitcoin is pretty wild. You can see swings in the $100's over the course of days. As such, I don't think we'll see mainstream adoption until stability can be witnessed through implementation of financial instruments by some kind of regulatory body. \n\nThought it was interesting too that Sir Richard B will be accepting Bitcoin on his Virgin Galatica space flights.
